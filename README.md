# Modular Architecture for Cognitive Systems (Macsy)
Intelligent systems for the annotation of content are increasingly being used for the automation of social science research. 

In this domain, the problem of integrating various Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms into a single intelligent system arises spontaneously. As part of an ongoing effort in automating content analysis for the social sciences, we have built a modular system by combining multiple AI modules into a flexible framework in which they can cooperate in complex tasks. 

This framework (Macsy) is flexible and allows the design and implementation of modular agents, where simple modules cooperate in the annotation of a large dataset without central coordination via a blackboard system <sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboard_system "Wikipedia: Blackboard system")</sup>.

Our system <sup>[2](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1402/1402.6208.pdf "The Anatomy of a Modular System for Media Content Analysis")</sup> built on top of the Macsy framework combines data gathering, machine translation, topic classification, extraction and annotation of entities and social networks, as well as many other tasks that have been perfected over the past years of AI research. Over the last few years, it has allowed us to realise a series of scientific studies over a vast range of applications including comparative studies between news outlets and media content in different countries, modelling of user preferences, and monitoring public mood.
